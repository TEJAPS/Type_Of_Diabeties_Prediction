# Type_Of_Diabeties_Prediction

Links:-
weights and bmi from here:- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2278314/
ppbs,hba1c,TSH = avg values were taken

Steps :-

1) importing libraries

2) getting records from excel sheet using pandas

3) getting to know about sheet completely

4) removing attributes which does't have output variable value(diabetic value)

5) removing redundant attribute (admission date, patient id)

6) dealing with NA values of all columns

7) conversion of data types

8) creating models using algorithms like logistic regression, knn, svc,naive bayes,decision tree

9) comparision using graph

10) finding correlation coefficent to know the dependency in between the input variables
again

11) removing dependent variables in input variables

12) removing columns whose availability is proportion in single digt percentage

13) finding suitablity values for k in knn

14) implementing algorithms 

15) comparision using graphs

16) Dealing with zeros in the complete dataset and applying generalization on Diabetes

17) implementing algorithms 

18) comparision using graphs

19) outliers handling normalizing in BMI

20) implementing algorithms 

21) comparision using graphs

22) storing the processed data in a new file

23) storing the model in .pkl file

24) using the model in .pkl file 

25) development of web app which predicts the type of diabetes

26) from the model stored in .pkl file using Flask.
