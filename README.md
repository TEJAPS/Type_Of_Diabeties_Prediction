# Type_Of_Diabeties_Prediction

Links:-
weights and bmi from here:- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2278314/
ppbs,hba1c,TSH = avg values were taken

Steps :-

importing libraries
getting records from excel sheet using pandas
getting to know about sheet completely
removing attributes which does't have output variable value(diabetic value)
removing redundant attribute (admission date, patient id)
dealing with NA values of all columns
conversion of data types

creating models using algorithms like logistic regression, knn, svc,naive bayes,decision tree
comparision using graph

finding correlation coefficent to know the dependency in between the input variables
again
removing dependent variables in input variables
removing columns whose availability is proportion in single digt percentage
finding suitablity values for k in knn
implementing algorithms 
comparision using graphs

Dealing with zeros in the complete dataset and applying generalization on Diabetes
implementing algorithms 
comparision using graphs


outliers handling normalizing in BMI
implementing algorithms 
comparision using graphs

storing the processed data in a new file
storing the model in .pkl file

using the model in .pkl file 
development of web app which predicts the type of diabetes
from the model stored in .pkl file using Flask.
